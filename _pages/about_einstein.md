I am student from EPN college, I am studying engineering in Computer Science since 2021. I graduated in IB high school.

Since I was little, I was captivated by the world of computing. Driven by an insatiable curiosity to understand how things work, I have spent countless hours disassembling toys, radios, and even computers. This fascination with technology led me to explore different areas of computing, learning self-taught and always looking for new challenges.

My passion for computing has not only translated into a hobby, but has become my professional path. In 2021, I entered the National Polytechnic School (EPN) to study Computer Science Engineering, where I have found a conducive environment to deepen my knowledge and develop my technical skills.

Being part of the EPN community has been an enriching experience, where I have had the opportunity to collaborate with talented colleagues and dedicated teachers. I have actively participated in research and development projects, which has allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real problems.

My greatest achievement has been overcoming the obstacles and challenges that have come my way, always maintaining motivation and perseverance to achieve my goals. I am convinced that my training at the EPN will allow me to become a highly qualified computer engineer and contribute significantly to the development of technology in Ecuador.
